# Description
The purpose of this project was to create a two player game to see who knows the actor best by guessing how many times Owen Wilson says "wow" in his films. This project was built to show understanding with local storage, as well as 3rd party api's. This application creates a fun atmosphere to test knowledge of movie fans against one another.
